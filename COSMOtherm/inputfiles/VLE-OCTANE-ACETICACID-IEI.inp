#
# Computation of an isothermal (fixed temperature) binary phase diagram of a reactive
# species (acetic acid which dimerizes in octane solution dependent on the solute
# concentration). The dimerization reaction is described by the interaction energy
# index (IEI) formalism of COSMOtherm (see section 5.8 of the COSMOtherm manual).
#
# High quality COSMO-files (BP-TZVP-COSMO) and appropriate parametrizations are used.
#
# Experimental pure compound vapor pressures are used in the computation of the binary
# phase diagram properties. Experimental data (Wagner equation coefficients) is given
# in the compound input area of the input file.
#
# The computed phase diagram data can be found in the mixture output section of output-
# file VLE-OCTANE-ACETICACID-IEI.out and in the table-file VLE-OCTANE-ACETICACID-IEI.tab.

# Options used      - Explanation
#
# ctd=...           - give name of parameterization file
# cdir=...          - give directory (search path) of parameterization file
# fdir=...          - give directory (search path) of compounds COSMO-files
# vpfile            - use vapor pressure / property file from "fdir" for the estimation
#                     of the pure compounds vapor pressures. This option reads in
#                     "compound.vap" files with experimental Antoine or Wagner equation
#                     coefficients, which are used to compute the vapor pressure of the
#                     pure compounds. The "compound.vap" filesare expected to be in the
#                     same directory as the cosmo/ccf file. If no "compound.vap" file is
#                     found, COSMOtherm will use its generic prediction method to estimate
#                     the pure compound vapor pressures.
#
# f=*.cosmo         - compound input
# [...]             - conformer input, square brackets identify start and end of an conformer block.
#                     Each conformer has to be given in a separate line. All molecules given within
#                     this conformer block will be regarded by COSMOtherm as one single compound!
#                     The contribution of the different conformers are weighted due to their
#                     relative free energies in the mixture.
# IEI=...           - Give interaction energy index (IEI-number) for this reaction
#                     (the dimerization reaction requires a single IEI-number)
#
# tc=...            - temperature in [°C]
# binary            - toggles automatic binary phase diagram computation.
# EN_IEI={ i  j  c_H  c_S }
#                   - interaction energy for the reaction of the IEI-number i with
#                     IEI-number j. c_H is the interaction enthalpy parameter, c_S is
#                     the interaction entropy parameter. See section 5.8 of the
#                     COSMOtherm users manual for detailed information on the use
#                     of interaction energy indices for the description of reactions.
